					<p>This was a very interesting and challenging project. I had never made a website before so it took a lot of time just making sure everything was consistent and viewable. It also turns out there are not a lot of good free stock photos of geologists doing work!</p>
					<p>I am glad I got this experience of building a website to host files and information. However, I really wish we had had more notice that we were going to be building a website or more time to complete it. I don’t really see how this part of the assignment ties in to the rest of what we’ve been learning in this class about metadata, and it seems like it should since the website itself took several days’ worth of work, much more than the rest of the assignment components.</p>
					<p>The analysis was fun. It had not occurred to me to present things graphically when we first turned in the plans for the metadata schema in an earlier assignment. So I decided to give it a shot. It was a little difficult to decide how to represent the entities and their relationships to the metadata elements because I had only been thinking about them as words so far. But once I decided how to make a visual representation it was fun to try to figure out which elements applied to the sample or the researcher.</p>
					<p>It was also a bit of a challenge to decide what to do for the controlled vocabulary part of the assignment. Most of the elements I have are free text or will be defined by other internal files and databases (free-text descriptions, researcher names, project names, etc.). But one of the elements that is prescribed is the country abbreviations. I looked up three letter abbreviations for country names and found that there is a relevant ISO standard for 3-letter country codes, so I used that.</p>
					<p>It was good to get the opportunity to practice building a whole metadata application profile. I think it would have been easier if we had looked at some developed application profiles in class for common metadata schemas as a whole, to get an idea of what they are before trying to do this assignment. This was a very good assignment, but it would have been better to have more examples before trying to do it blind.</p>
